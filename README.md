# A BGK kinetic model for the study of plasma boundary conditions at the electrodes of corona discharges

## WORK IN PROGRESS

A `C++` code implementing a finite volume solver for the BGK Boltzmann Equation in the context of ionic propulsion. Near the electrode the continuum description of the plasma is no longer valid thus a statistical one is needed, the aim is to solve numerically a simplified version of the Boltzmann equation comparing the results with external reliable sources.
