• checkkare la presenza di tutti i constructor, copy and movable in tutte le classi
• ask if the std::range concept is useful e quindi nel caso modificare i for loop
• riformulare i constructor
• gnuplot / script python per visualizzare la visualize_mesh
• see if its possible on paraview to show the computational points
• correct !is_inititialized with !validate_mesh quando opportuno
• remove is constructed
• ask chatGPT the thing about recursive inclusion

FUTURE
• pch to spedup compiling (see conversation)
• logger in NDBUG mode like a class that can do myLogger.logWarning(msg);
