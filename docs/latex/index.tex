A {\ttfamily C++} code implementing a finite volume solver for the BGK Boltzmann Equation in the context of ionic propulsion. Near the electrode the continuum description of the plasma is no longer valid thus a statistical one is needed, the aim is to solve numerically a simplified version of the Boltzmann equation comparing the results with external reliable sources.
